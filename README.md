# HqllrEnterprise — Sovereign AI for Business
*From personal knowledge engines to enterprise-scale, verifiable clusters.*

HqllrEnterprise extends the Hqllr ecosystem to meet the demands of businesses, research groups, and institutions. Built for security, compliance, and scale — while staying true to Hqllr’s core principles: **Local. Sovereign. Verifiable.**

## Why HqllrEnterprise
- **Federation at Scale** — connect teams and clusters with fine-grained data sharing.
- **Audit-Ready** — append-only history with verifiable hashes for compliance.
- **Policy-Driven Access** — control who sees what, down to document or sentence level.
- **Observability** — cluster-wide insights, monitoring, and performance tuning.
- **Enterprise Support** — service agreements, deployment tooling, and integration packs.
